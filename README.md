## Description:

Basic shell program written in C featuring both interactive and batch modes.


## How to build the software

Type "make" to compile the software.


## How to use the software

Run the software from the command line as usual. To run the shell in interactive mode, provide no other arguments.
To run the shell in batch mode, provide one or more batch files as arguments. These batch files should have a command for each line.
When running multiple batch files at the same time, the program will execute all of the commands in all files in one run, without providing
any separation between file runs.


## How the software was tested

TODO


## Known bugs and problem areas

File redirection is not yet implemented.
